There's almost certainly a better way to do this, but after many many hours this is the best I came up with. If you know
a better way, please let me know.<br /><br />
<h3>Create XKB symbols file with your remapping</h3> <br />
<script
    type="syntaxhighlighter">xkb_symbols "page_home_end" {   replace key <PGUP> { [ End ] };         replace key <PGDN> { [ Prior ] };         replace key <END> { [ Next ] }; }; </script>
