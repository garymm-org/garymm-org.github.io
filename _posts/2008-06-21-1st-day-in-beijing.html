I was supposed to arrive in Beijing on the 19th, but I was very foolish and missed my flight. In an attempt to avoid paying “foreigner prices” once more, I spent a long time haggling with different taxi drivers (or rather Linh did, because she speaks Vietnamese). By the time I settled on one (which wasn't a particularly good deal), it was very late, and despite some particularly insane driving, I did not make my flight. So I purchased another $300 ticket to Beijing for the next day, and walked down the road and stayed at the airport hotel. Lesson learned: don't haggle over a few dollars when you need to get to the airport.<br/><br/>	So I'm finally here now, more or less settled in my dorm room. As soon as I got to the airport yesterday, there was excitement. I needed to kill a few hours until the Princeton in Beijing (PiB) bus would arrive to take me to the  Beijing Normal University campus, where I'll be for another 8 weeks. I was hungry, and had the choice between KFC (“kěn dé jī”) and Starbucks (no chinese name!), and I chose a smoked salmon sandwich at the latter. No sooner had I sat down and started munching on my sandwich than a police officer pulled police tape across the entrance to Starbucks, and one of the other patrons suggested that I not sit near the door.<br/><br/>	I looked up to see that someone had left a purse near the area where arrivals clear customs, and apparently the police suspected said purse to contain a bomb. At first I watched the spectacle along with the staff and other patrons of Starbucks. After a few minutes of this, but luckily after I had finished my sandwich, a police officer came in and ordered the establishment evacuated. So we all left, walking along the edge of the police line. Once back outside the Starbucks, I got to peek through the crowd that was forming to catch a glimpse of the bomb-squad and their robots. I didn't stick around to watch exactly what happened, but eventually the crowd cleared, and I saw the purse was gone. Here are some pictures of the incident:<br/>Here's a picture of the police officers overseeing the evacuation of the starbucks:<br/><a href='http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01764.jpg'><img src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01764-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Police officers overseeing the evacuation of the airport starbucks" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19" /></a><br/><br/>Here's a blurry picture of the bomb squad robot in action:<br/><a href='http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01767.jpg'><img src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01767-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="The bomb-squad robot in action at the Beijing airport" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20" /></a><br/><br/>	In 30 minutes I have my placement exam. I hope it is not too stressful. I have no idea what level they'll place me in. I don't know how Berkeley's Chinese program compares to Princeton's, and I also don't know how much I've retained, since I haven't studied Chinese for more than 5 weeks now. Anyways, I'd rather be in too low a level than too high.<br/><br/>This is my roommate:<br/><a href='http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01769.jpg'><img src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dsc01769-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Randy my roommate" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-21" /></a><br/>His name is Randy. His Chinese name is Lǐ Rán (李然）. He's pretty cool. Like most people here, he's an undergraduate at Princeton.
