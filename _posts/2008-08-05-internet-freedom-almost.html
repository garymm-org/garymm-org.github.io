<span> </span>I'm sure you've all heard about all the things that the government is doing to make Beijing pretty for the
olympics. What matters to me, though, is that today I can log on to <a
    href="http://www.colbertnation.com/"><span>www.colbertnation.com</span></a> ! Previously this was blocked. I can
also download open source software from sourceforge, and I can look at most of wikipedia in Chinese, but even the
English article on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests is still blocked.<br /><br /><span> </span>Things will probably go
back to they way they were before in a few weeks once people stop looking, but at least I can watch the Colbert Report
for my remaining 11 days in China.
