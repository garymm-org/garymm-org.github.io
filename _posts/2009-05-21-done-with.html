I'm done with so much, for now at least. School, Chinese, Berkeley, organized sports, so many friends.<br/><br/>I'll just share one little awesome Chinese phrase that I learned in Berkeley, which goes against the trend of my vocabulary only shrinking since I left Beijing. The phrase is dǎ fēijī (打飞机， 打飛機）, which translates literally as "to hit the airplane". I'll leave it to my intelligent and imaginative readers to figure out what that actually means.<br/><br/>Anyways, I'll soon be departing for the Near (or Middle?) East, and so I should have some interesting things to write about, and hopefully some good pictures to share. On to post-undergraduate life!
