After hearing and reading and largely being convinced that investment professionals largely don't know what they're
doing, I decided to take a fresh look at my investments. As part of that process, I took a look at Morningstar's
FundInvestor newsletter. On <a href="http://www.morningstar.com/Products/Store_FundInvestor.html">the very page
    advertizing the premium newsletter</a>, I found this wonderful little chart:<br />
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
    <dl id="attachment_44" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 190px;">
        <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.morningstar.com/Products/Store_FundInvestor.html"><img
                    class="size-full wp-image-44" title="morningstar returns"
                    src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/morningstarreturns.png"
                    alt="5 year annualized returns" width="180" height="108" /></a></dt>
    </dl>
</div><br />If that's not enough to convince you that nobody knows what they're talking about, what is?
