I think I did a decent job in telling the<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/?p=58"> story of the amazing
    day that Linh and I had in Syria</a>. Now I'd like to share my thoughts on something that struck me on that
day.<br /><br />Our host on that day was a Syrian English teacher named Ahmad. We learned a lot talking to him: about
his family, public education in Syria, culture, politics, and so on. As I noted in an <a
    href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garymm/blog/?p=72">earlier post</a>, Linh loved asking Ahmad about his religion.
I'd like to share some of the things that stick out in my mind on this topic.<br /><br /><strong>The
    Hajj</strong><br />When we were hanging out with Ahmad and his father,Â  Linh asked, "Has your father been to
Mecca?"<br /><br />"Oh yes, he and my mother went three years ago."<br /><br />"Did he like it?", she
asked.<br /><br />"Oh yes. It is very nice. When you get there, everything is free. The government of Saudi Arabia pays
for everything. You can eat as much McDonalds as you like."<br /><br />That's right. In Mecca, the holiest place on
Earth, during the Hajj, one of the most sacred rites in a Muslim's life, the food that the pilgrims eat is none other
good old McDonald's. ((I would guess this is because McDonald's is subsidizing the food to promote itself. And the
reason that the pilgrims are excited about it is that in some poorer countries, American fast food is actually more
expensive than local options, and is seen as a luxury (<a title="Time: KFC in China"
    href="http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,543845,00.html">KFC in China is the classic
    example</a>).))<br /><br />Ahmad told us that there are some very rich people who like to go to Mecca every year,
but that most people can only afford to go once or twice in their whole lives, since they have to pay for their own
transit. If one has enough money, one buys a plane ticket. Otherwise, a very long bus journey is required (1,650km /
1,025 miles as the crow flies).<br /><br />Upon returning home the pilgrims are celebrated, by others and themselves,
too. They <a title="Decorations indicating a succesful Hajj"

everybody knows about it. The <a title="Photo of Ahmad's house"

    that Ahmad lives in</a> is painted in this way, but that's only because it used to be his parents'
house.<br /><br /><strong>Taboos</strong><br />Ahmad appeared to me to be a devoutly religious man, and we talked at
great length about his religious beliefs and practices. Some of the things that he said and did during our few hours
together that really made me think of him as a religious man:<br />
<ul><br />
    <li>The entire time we were in his house, his television was constantly tuned to bearded men talking about the
        Qur'an.</li><br />
    <li>After eating, we continued to sit with him and his family and just chat and play with his children. At one
        point, he abruptly took a break from our conversation and went into the corner and began kneeling and bowing and
        praying.</li><br />
    <li>Often in the course of our conversation, he mentioned that certain things are not allowed by Islam. The word he
        used over and over was "taboo". Some of the things that are taboo to Ahmad:<br />
        <ul><br />
            <li>Men wearing gold jewelery (more on this later).</li><br />
            <li>Eating pork.</li><br />
            <li>Men and women living together without being married.</li><br />
            <li>Watching sexually explicit Egyptian or American movies (though watching violent movies is fine).</li>
            <br />
        </ul><br />
    </li><br />
</ul><br /><strong>Questionable claims</strong><br />All of these things are apparently barred by the Qu'ran, but for
some of them, Ahmad explained, there was also scientific evidence. The issue of jewelery came up when we asked Ahmad if
it was customary for men and women to exchange wedding rings. Ahmad explained that the Qu'ran forbids men from wearing
gold, and that a scientist did a study that found that wearing gold makes men sterile.<br /><br />Ahmad also mentioned
to us that a sheikh on television said that an astronaut went into outer space and heard the words of the
Qur'an.<br /><br />When Linh told Ahmad that she thought that the call to prayer was beautiful, even though she had no
idea what the words meant, Ahmad told us another story he heard from a TV sheikh:<br /><br />This sheikh claimed that he
was in the United States, sitting in a room with the door open, reading the Qur'an, when a man overheard him, walked in
and said,<br /><br />"What is that sound? What are those words? Those are the most beautiful words I've ever
heard."<br /><br />The sheikh told the American man that he was reading the Qur'an, and then, to use Ahmad's phrasing,
the American "entered Islam".<br /><br />When we were in the slaughterhouse, watching the men saying "<em><a
        title="Bismillah" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismillah">Bismillah</a>, <a title="Allahu Akbar"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahu_Akbar">Allahu Akbar</a></em>", Ahmed told us that this protected the
food. He told us a scientist did an experiment with two apples. Over one apple, he said the words, and over the other,
he did not. Both were left out for a long time in the same place, and then both were tested for germs. I'm sure my
astute readers can guess the exciting conclusion to that experiment.<br /><br />I've saved the most surprising and
hilarious dubious claim for last:<br />We were talking about the relationship between Syria and the United States, when
Ahmad said that people in Syria like Barack Obama, and that his relationship with Bashar al-Assad (the president of
Syria) is quite good. And then it came, the shocker:<br /><br />"We have heard also, that Obama is a Muslim", said
Ahmad.<br /><br />"No, I think he is a Christian. His father was a Muslim, I think", Linh corrected him.<br /><br />Some
Christians in the USA refused to vote for Obama because they erroneously thought he is a Muslim, and in Syria, Muslims
like him because they also erroneously think he's a Muslim. To quote Stephen Colbert, "Why won't that story
die?"<br /><br /><strong>Tolerance and intolerance</strong><br />When we asked him about it, Ahmad tried to give us a
brief explanation of why he is Sunna and not Shia, and his explanation was something along the lines of "They believe
that Ali is the prophet, not Mohammed" (or some other untrue distortion of what Shia believe, as far as I could tell),
and thus they are bad. He explained that almost everyone in Syria is a Sunna, and made it clear that he thinks Shia are
very wrong in their beliefs.<br /><br />Still, he explained that there are Christian people, and even a few Shia in
Syria, and that they are allowed to worship as they please. The Christian women are even allowed to walk around
unveiled.<br /><br />Linh asked Ahmad how people felt about president <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asma_al-Assad" target="_blank">Assad's wife</a>, since she was very "open" as
Ahmad called it. She doesn't wear a veil, and she has a much more active professional life than most Syrian
women.<br /><br />Ahmad gracefully dodged this question, saying only,<br />"We only hope the president is successful in
creating more jobs for Syrian people."<br /><br />This sounded like, "It bothers me, but it's not my place to criticize
the president", to my ears.<br /><br />So, then, how would I summarize Ahmad's religiosity? He observes religious
rituals many times a day, and heeds the guidance of religious leaders on television. He seems to believe some very silly
things about gold and germs. He is obviously extremely willing to engage with non-Muslims: his almost absurd generosity
towards Linh and me is proof enough of that, and Ahmad told us that we were not the first Westerners to be so
lucky.<br /><br />Perhaps the main difference between Ahmad and most of the religious people around me in my day to day
life is that I witnessed Ahmad practicing his religion, and he spoke specifically about his beliefs, so there was no
ambiguity.<br /><br />I must say that before I met Ahmad, I thought someone who looks to bearded, stern-looking sheikhs
on television for guidance on how to live life would be someone I have nothing in common with, or maybe even someone to
be avoided. And yet, Ahmad turned out to be one of the most kind, generous, and even inquisitive persons I've ever met.
