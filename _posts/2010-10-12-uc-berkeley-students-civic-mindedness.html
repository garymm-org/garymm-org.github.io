I just finished reading Chris Hedges' <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HVpjRAAACAAJ"><i>Empire of
        Illusion</i></a>. It is certainly a provocative book, lambasting several aspects of American culture and society
separately, all culminating in a final fifty-page-long chapter titled "The Illusion of America". Overall I found the
book worth while, but near the end it devolved into a repetitive rant.<br /><br />In his chapter on American
universities, "The Illusion of Knowledge", Hedges spends a great deal of time discussing UC Berkeley, my alma mater.
Since I know some things about UC Berkeley and I think Hedges' claims are interesting, I've decided to respond to some
of what he wrote.<br /><br />To understand my response, one must first understand the tone of <span
    style="font-style: italic;">Empire</span>. It is basically a long analysis of what's wrong with the USA, and so when
I say that Hedges discusses Berkeley, I really mean he holds Berkeley out as an example of the decline of American
universities. Hedges claims the universities, Berkeley included, have "abandoned" their traditional role, which was "to
ask the broad moral and social questions" and are instead becoming "high-priced occupational training
centers".<br /><br />Hedges extends this criticism to the students themselves through&nbsp;Chris Hebdon, an
undergraduate student at UC Berkeley who Hedges quotes extensively. Hebdon's first assertion is that the student
activism that made Berkeley so famous forty five years ago has almost completely disappeared. Instead of being concerned
about "globalization, corporatization, or ... the commercialization of Berkeley", students and professors are focused on
"trends, prestige, and money".<br /><br />My initial reaction to Hebdon's criticisms might be vocalized as: "Shut up.
It's not a problem that most students are not Marxist activists." Upon further reflection, I still disagree with what he
says. As for the list of things he wants students to be concerned about: Globalization is a phenomenon that affects many
aspects of our society. Berkeley students study it and live it, but it is not an issue that demands radical student
action. Corporatization is not a well-defined word. So that leaves the commercialization of Berkeley. I'll discuss that
later, but basically the point is that Hebdon wants students to be upset about issues that I don't think are major
problems.<br /><br />However, I think Hebdon's criticism is valid in one sense: many Berkeley students are not concerned
with politics or current events. I don't want to exaggerate or oversimplify, as Hedges does. Political Science is a very
popular major, and there are many students concerned with and involved in politics. But I do think there is a huge
segment of the student population that does not care about what is going on in the world, and that is a problem.
Berkeley students are among those who will become very influential, and the widespread lack of civic-mindedness among
the students makes me think that many will not actively use their influence to improve the world.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />This discussion so far is lacking something
vital: data. Luckily the University conducts an extensive survey of its undergraduate students that includes questions
relevant to our discussion. Looking at <a href="http://osr2.berkeley.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/UcuesHome">Berkeley's
    Undergraduate Experience Survey results</a> from <a
    href="http://osr2.berkeley.edu/twiki/pub/Main/UcuesSurvey2008/results.html#ce">2008</a> and <a
    href="http://osr2.berkeley.edu/twiki/pub/Main/UcuesSurvey2009/results.html#q_part_iii_civic_engageme_anchor">2009</a>,
we can begin to ground what we have been discussing.<br /><br />Now for a super-mega-graph of civic
engagement:<br /><img
    src="https://spreadsheets.google.com/oimg?key=0AlLRmswVKdnDdFk2S0IySmNEMFF5ODN5N3M4b1pfRmc&amp;oid=8&amp;zx=rhln4p-pq8v91" /><br />I
have written a separate post that contains more detailed graphs and figures, but I'll briefly explain each of the
measures here.<br /><br />Each of the measures is a proportion. "Will probably vote" includes students who said they
will "probably" or "definitely" vote in the next election. "Will probably vote (C)" is the same thing, but taken as a
proportion only of American citizens. "Talked about campaign" includes those students who said they "talked about the
campaign with other students" either "a great deal", or "a significant amount". Finally, "Paid attention to issues"
includes those students who said they "paid attention to candidates and issues"either "a great deal" or "a significant
amount".<br /><br />I don't have data to substantiate this claim, but I believe non-citizen students are less likely to
pay attention to and discuss politics. If that is the case, then the latter two measures are somewhat lower than they
would be had only citizens been surveyed.<br /><br />There is a lot more data to examine to try to get an idea of
students' worldviews and concerns. There are questions on community service, political self-identification, and time
use. However, from these few measures alone I see a complex picture emerge. It seems that almost all the students
planned to vote, but many did not discuss politics or pay attention to issues. How do these students decide how to vote?
I have to conclude that there are many students who are rather uninformed and yet still choose to vote.<br /><br />For
Chris Hebdon to make his point, he would need similar graphs showing a larger proportion of students paying attention to
or discussing "trends, prestige, and money" than they do politics.&nbsp; However, I'd say the graphs we have are enough
to show that many students are not passionate about politics. And as much as I dislike Hebdon's tone, I had the same
impression when I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. A lot of students there are mostly focused on their own
careers.<br /><br />Which brings us to the larger question: What should Berkeley students be doing with their time?
Should college be a time and a place for professional preparation and academic specialization, or for political protest
and social activism? Hebdon and Hedges obviously think it should be the latter. I have no problem with it being the
former. People always have the choice to move for social change. Only for a few short years do they have the opportunity
to explore intellectual and professional opportunities the way they can at a university.
