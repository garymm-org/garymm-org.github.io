Well, more than a year after the release of iTunes 9, it looks like Apple has blocked iTunes 8 from accessing the store.
This fits with Apple's overall strategy of rapid abandonment of the old in favor of the new.<br /><br />I have been
sticking with version 8 for a few reasons:<br />
<ol>
    <li>I have wanted to make sure I could strip DRM from anything I bought. Apple introduces new protections into every
        version, and I wanted to stick with a thoroughly-cracked version.</li>
    <li>None of the new features appeal to me. New features often make the software slower, though I have no evidence to
        claim that this is the case here.</li>
</ol><br />Also very annoying is the fact that upon opening a new version of iTunes, one's old library metadata is
automatically converted and rendered unreadable by the old version. Perhaps I'll have to find another computer to buy
music with.
