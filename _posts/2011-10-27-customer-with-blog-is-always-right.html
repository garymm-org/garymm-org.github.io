Last week I wrote a <a href="/blog/2011/10/20/customer-service-from-monopoly/">post complaining about
    Comcast</a>. Shortly thereafter, a Comcast employee left a comment on the post asking me to get in touch with
him so that he could "make this right". So I did, and Comcast did refund the fees that got me angry enough to write
the post in the first place.<br /><br /><br />So, my advice to readers:<br /><br />
<ol>
    <li>Watch your bills for unfair charges like the
        Rohirim watching for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_beacons_of_Gondor">warning beacons
            of Gondor</a>.</li>
    <li>At the first site of trouble, publicly shame the offenders.
    </li>
</ol>
Somehow I don't think this is what Comcast was hoping for
when they hired people to react to bad online publicity. But hey, at least I'm not switching ISP's.
