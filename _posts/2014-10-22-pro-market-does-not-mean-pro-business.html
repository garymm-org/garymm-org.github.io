<br />Re-listening to one of my favorite episodes of Planet Money, "<a
    href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/06/22/155596305/episode-381-why-its-illegal-to-braid-hair-without-a-license"
    target="_blank">Why It's Illegal To Braid Hair Without A License</a>" reminds me of the difference between
pro-market and pro-business policies. Some key quotes:<br />"Today, one in every three jobs requires a
license."<br />"You always hear this idea that business is opposed to regulation... Businesses are often in favor of
regulation, in fact they love it... it helps make them more money!"<br /><br />I encourage you to listen to the whole
thing.<br /><br />
