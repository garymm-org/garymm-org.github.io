This took me forever to set up properly, so I figured I'd share it.<br />For now just the basic outline. If have
questions on a detail ask and I can answer.<br />First my set-up:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>Windows 10 64 bit with Fall Creators Update</li>
    <li>GeForce GTX 960</li>
    <li>2016 LG OLED TV</li>
</ul><br /><br />The basic ingredients are these. Note I always used 64 bit versions of everything.<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=223175">Kodi DSPlayer</a>, I used 17.6, 64 bit</li>
    <li>Plex for Kodi add-on, I used 0.1.3. Install it from within Kodi.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases">LAV Filters</a>, I used 0.70.2</li>
    <li><a href="http://madvr.com/">MadVR</a>, I used v0.92.10</li>
</ul><br /><br />Basic steps:<br /><br />
<ol>
    <li>Install everything listed above.</li>
    <li>Replace Kodi DSPlayer's internal filters with the external ones: copy all the files files from <span
            style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\LAV Filters\x64</span> to <span
            style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">C:\Program
            Files\Kodi\system\players\dsplayer\LAVFilters</span>, replacing files at the destination.</li>
    <li>In the nVidia control panel, disable stereoscopic 3D. With the current drivers, enabling it causes crashes in
        madVR when Direct3D 11 is enabled and it goes full screen.</li>
    <li>I have HDR and Advanced Color disabled in the Windows 10 display settings. MadVR enables it during playback as
        needed, and it makes the desktop look bad when it's on.</li>
    <li>In Plex for Kodi Settings, enable HEVC streaming.</li>
    <li>On the LG OLED TV settings, disable Screen Shift. This setting shifts the image around by 1 pixel every few
        minutes, which will result in the line-interlaced image output by madVR not being aligned with the FPR (3D
        filter), which results in the left and right eyes being swapped. Note this will increase the risk of image
        retention.</li>
    <li>MadVR settings (just the required stuff, other settings you should probably mess with, lots of other guides on
        that):</li>
</ol><br /><br />
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>rendering -&gt; general settings: Use Direct3D 11 for presentation (required for 10-bit color output)</li>
        <li>rendering -&gt; stereo 3D: enable stereo 3D playback. Leave everything else unchecked.</li>
        <li>Devices -&gt; <your avr="" or="" tv=""> -&gt; properties: the native display bitdepth is 10 bit or higher
                (required for 10-bit color output).</your>
        </li>
        <li>Devices -&gt; <your avr="" or="" tv=""> -&gt; properties: 3D format is Line Alternative (this works for
                passive displays like LG OLEDs, *not* for any other kind of display)</your>
        </li>
        <li>Devices -&gt; <your avr="" or="" tv=""> -&gt; hdr: passthrough HDR content to the display, and send HDR
                metadata to the display</your>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul><br /><br />

someone else.
