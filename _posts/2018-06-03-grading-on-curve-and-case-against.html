<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;">I recently read <a
                        href="https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1400889324">The Case Against Education</a>, which
                argues that
                education pays off for individuals mostly because it sends signals about intelligence and
                conscientiousness,
                <i>not</i>&nbsp;because it equips students with useful skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
                face="arial, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;">Here's a puzzle which was not addressed in the book,
                but may be solved by that
                model.</span><br /></span>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">My university courses were mostly graded on curves. I
                think Advanced Placement exams are also graded on curves, but I'm less sure of this. At the time this
                didn't
                make sense to me. If the point of taking the courses was to gain skills, shouldn't there be an objective
                scale
                of how much skill a student gained? And shouldn't students be graded against this objective scale,
                rather than
                on how they place in the distribution of students who happen to take the exam on the same day as them?
                Objective
                grading seems especially feasible for technical courses like math, but I could imagine it being
                plausible for
                humanities courses like history as well.</span></div>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But if the point of a school transcript is not so much
                to say "Look at all these skills I acquired!", but rather to say "Here's where I am in the distribution
                of
                students who got this degree at this university", then the mystery is dissolved. The latter is obviously
                more in
                accordance with the signaling model.</span></div>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Of course there are other reasonable explanations for
                grading on a curve, even in technical courses. If imposed by the department or university, it can be
                used as a
                defense against grade inflation. I believe it had that effect at my undergraduate university, where some
                departments had distributions that all professors were supposed to adhere to, and those departments had
                generally lower grades. But again, wanting to maintain the same grade distribution over many years is
                inconsistent with that grade being an objective measure of skill gained, unless we assume zero change in
                pedagogical methods, how much knowledge students have coming in, or just random variation in class
                achievement.</span></div>
