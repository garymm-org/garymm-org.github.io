            Anybody who speaks English and walks around Beijing long enough is bound to run into a few people wearing shirts that
have ridiculous things written on them. In my humble view as an amateur fashionista, travel writer, and sociologist, the
ridiculous things fall into three categories:<br /><br />1.<span> </span>English that people in the USA would just never
wear because it's silly or too happy.<br /><br />2.<span> </span>English that is riddled with spelling and grammar
mistakes, or just no makes no sense at all.<br /><br />3.<span> </span>English that has connotations that the wearers
most probably do not understand.<br /><br />One example of the first category that I've seen is a man wearing a shirt
that said:<br /><br />LOVE!<br /><br />YOU!<br /><br />An example of the third category that I saw with my own eyes was
a woman wearing a shirt that said:<br /><br />Nike<br /><br />I LIKE<br /><br />TO BE<br /><br />ON TOP<br /><br />I
really doubt she knew the connotation of that shirt. A pretty great example that I heard about second hand was a woman
wearing a shirt that had a big rainbow on the top, underneath which were written the words:<br /><br />I'm so gay I shit
rainbows!<br /><br />The person who saw this shirt asked the lady why she was wearing it and she said “I think the
rainbow is really pretty. I don't know what the words mean”.<br /><br />Luckily, for the second category you don't have
to rely on my descriptions, as today I blew my 3<span>rd</span> place prize money from the PiB speech contest on amazing
examples of category 2. I am going to really enjoy putting these on, but I doubt seeing me wearing them in the USA will
be nearly as funny as me seeing Chinese people wearing them.<br /><br />Click the slideshow below to see big versions of
any of the pictures. If you want me to buy you a shirt, email me soon and let me know.<br /><br /><object
