            I'm moving soon. When I realized I had to move a few months ago, I started doing research to determine the best place to
move to. One thing I considered was crime. For most of the cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was satisfied with
looking at the city-level crime statistics collected by the California Department of Justice. However, I was also
considering living in San Francisco, and I didn't think it would be meaningful to compare the aggregate crime statistics
for a city with a population of eight hundred and five thousand to those of much smaller cities.<br /><br />So here's
the question I set out to answer: <b>How can I compare the crime rates of one neighborhood in San Francisco and those of
    an entire California city?</b><br /><br />Unfortunately I couldn't find data aggregated per neighborhood.&nbsp;The
most granular but still usable data I could get was for one San Francisco police district. Finding the data I wanted for
a police district was more difficult than I would have hoped, and once I found it, understanding how it related to the
city-level crime statistics collected by the California DoJ was even more work.<br /><br />
<h4>1. Get the data for the San Francisco police district.</h4>For San Francisco, to get an annual report for a
particular district, go <a href="http://sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=3255" target="_blank">here</a> (or if the link
breaks later, go to CompStat home -&gt; Reports).<br /><br />Click on the year you're interested in. For my purposes I
want 2009, since that's the latest data that the state has.<br /><br />Then at the bottom there are "2009 vs 2008
reports by district".<br />Here's the one for <a
    href="http://www.sf-police.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=24093" target="_blank">Ingleside</a>.<br />
<h4><br /></h4>
<h4>2. Get the data for any city in California.</h4>Go to this page to get&nbsp;<a
    href="http://ag.ca.gov/cjsc/statisticsdatatabs/CrimeCity.php" target="_blank">reports for all cities in California,
    broken up by county.</a><br />
<h4><br /></h4>
<h4>3. Compare them.</h4>So now how to clear up the confusing bits:<br />The California city-level numbers show arson
separately from other property crimes, but the San Francisco district numbers include arson in the property crimes
category. What I did was to add the arson number to the total property crimes number. This number is then comparable
with the total property crimes number reported by the SF districts.<br /><br />Also, ignore the Larceny-Theft numbers
completely. Before 2011, $400 was the minimum for a theft to be considered a "grand theft". The SF districts only report
grand thefts, while the per-city figures show both grand and regular thefts.<br /><br />Finally, be sure to normalize by
population. The SF district reports show the district's population at the top. For a California city, you can get the <a
    href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06000.html" target="_blank">data from the census</a>.<br />

<div>Hopefully others find this helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have been able to figure this out without the help of
    Deanne Machado from the Davis Police Department, so many thanks to her.</div>
