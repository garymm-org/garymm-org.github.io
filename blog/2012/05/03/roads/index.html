            <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">A recruiter
    from Netflix sent me an email with the subject line "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads". For those who
    don't recognize it, it's a famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9ws2PpDw3o" target="_blank">quote from
        Back to the Future</a>. I wasn't interested in the job, but I was interested in her choice of quote. You see, a
    couple years ago, Back to the Future was released on blu-ray, which got me excited to watch it again. Unfortunately,
    even though I pay Netflix extra money every month to be able to rent blu-ray discs from them, they didn't have Back
    to the Future on blu-ray.</span><br /><span
    style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><br /></span><br /><span
    style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">I actually took
    the time to call and complain about this. The Netflix customer support person I spoke to was very surprised to hear
    Netflix didn't have it available, and he logged my complaint. Still, a year later, and Netflix still doesn't have
    the discs I want. This week I broke down and finally bought the discs myself. This post is my last gasp of
    bitterness against Netflix and/or Universal before I just watch the movies and move on. But dangit, if you're going
    to use a line from a movie to recruit new employees, you should at least have the movie available on blu-ray (or at
    least streaming).</span>
