After spending quite
  a bit of time deciding what learning materials to start with, I decided on fast.ai&apos;s Practical Deep Learning for
  Coders (I saw the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://course19.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;2019 version&lt;/a&gt;). Overall I highly recommend the course,
  and I&apos;m planning to go back and do the 2020 version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I was excited about fast.ai&apos;s course is that they had some content on &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/swift&quot;&gt;Swift for TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(S4TF). I have written a lot of Python and
  while it has its place, I was excited to try something new and hopefully better. I watched the two fast.ai videos on
  S4TF and then decided to try it out. This ended up being a fairly costly mistake for me. Basically S4TF is just not
  nearly as mature as PyTorch, and I wasted a bunch of time struggling with environment setup (no equivalent
  to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;conda install&lt;/span&gt;), bugs, very incomplete documentation, and cryptic
  error messages. At this point (I tried in 2020-09), I suggest you steer clear of S4TF if your primary goal is just to
  learn ML. Though it was fun to learn some Swift and I&apos;d definitely consider using Swift in future projects, ML or
  otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that multi-week detour out of the way, I decided to focus on PyTorch. For my first task I decided to try to
  recreate the simplest model presented in the fast.ai course, but without using the fastai library at all, just pure
  PyTorch. I found that almost all of the special stuff in fastai is included in PyTorch as of 1.6, so this was a lot
  easier than I expected. Here&apos;s my final &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://github.com/garymm/mlnbs/blob/master/collaborative-filtering.ipynb&quot;&gt;notebook for this collaborative
    filtering task&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the issues I ran into and how I resolved them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For this task, using the GPU was much slower than just using the CPU. I suppose this is because the model is so
    simple that the overhead of copying data to/from the GPU dominates any speedup in actual calculations. In retrospect
    this was also probably why training my Swift version of the model was so slow, and &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/issues/524#issuecomment-680919423&quot;&gt;S4TF doesn&apos;t allow eager tensors to
      use the CPU&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if a GPU is present, so this would have been much harder to discover and work around in
    Swift.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fastai wraps the &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;torch.nn.Embedding&lt;/span&gt; type with a function that changes
    the initial values. PyTorch initializes using random values drawn from a normal distribution with&amp;nbsp;ùúé^2 = 1.
    Fastai changes this to a normal distribution with&amp;nbsp;ùúé^2 = .01, truncated so no value is farther than 2 standard
    deviations from the mean. They reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09160&quot;&gt;An Exploration of Word Embedding
      Initialization in Deep-Learning Tasks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as justification. I found this provided a small boost in
    performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forgot calls to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;squeeze()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; in a
      few places. I was quite surprised that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;torch.nn.MSELoss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
      style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;didn&apos;t throw an error when I provided it two tensors of different shapes.
      Instead it did some averaging over all the values, which led to poor training performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                        href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1400889324&quot;&gt;The Case Against Education&lt;/a&gt;, which
                argues that
                education pays off for individuals mostly because it sends signals about intelligence and
                conscientiousness,
                &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;because it equips students with useful skills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                face=&quot;arial, sans-serif&quot; style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s a puzzle which was not addressed in the book,
                but may be solved by that
                model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;My university courses were mostly graded on curves. I
                think Advanced Placement exams are also graded on curves, but I&apos;m less sure of this. At the time this
                didn&apos;t
                make sense to me. If the point of taking the courses was to gain skills, shouldn&apos;t there be an objective
                scale
                of how much skill a student gained? And shouldn&apos;t students be graded against this objective scale,
                rather than
                on how they place in the distribution of students who happen to take the exam on the same day as them?
                Objective
                grading seems especially feasible for technical courses like math, but I could imagine it being
                plausible for
                humanities courses like history as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;But if the point of a school transcript is not so much
                to say &quot;Look at all these skills I acquired!&quot;, but rather to say &quot;Here&apos;s where I am in the distribution
                of
                students who got this degree at this university&quot;, then the mystery is dissolved. The latter is obviously
                more in
                accordance with the signaling model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course there are other reasonable explanations for
                grading on a curve, even in technical courses. If imposed by the department or university, it can be
                used as a
                defense against grade inflation. I believe it had that effect at my undergraduate university, where some
                departments had distributions that all professors were supposed to adhere to, and those departments had
                generally lower grades. But again, wanting to maintain the same grade distribution over many years is
                inconsistent with that grade being an objective measure of skill gained, unless we assume zero change in
                pedagogical methods, how much knowledge students have coming in, or just random variation in class
                achievement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>garymm</name></author><category term="education" /><summary type="html">I recently read The Case Against Education, which argues that education pays off for individuals mostly because it sends signals about intelligence and conscientiousness, not&amp;nbsp;because it equips students with useful skills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here&apos;s a puzzle which was not addressed in the book, but may be solved by that model.

If have
questions on a detail ask and I can answer.&lt;br /&gt;First my set-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Windows 10 64 bit with Fall Creators Update&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GeForce GTX 960&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2016 LG OLED TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic ingredients are these. Note I always used 64 bit versions of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=223175&quot;&gt;Kodi DSPlayer&lt;/a&gt;, I used 17.6, 64 bit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Plex for Kodi add-on, I used 0.1.3. Install it from within Kodi.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases&quot;&gt;LAV Filters&lt;/a&gt;, I used 0.70.2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madvr.com/&quot;&gt;MadVR&lt;/a&gt;, I used v0.92.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Install everything listed above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Replace Kodi DSPlayer&apos;s internal filters with the external ones: copy all the files files from &lt;span
            style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\LAV Filters\x64&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span
            style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;C:\Program
            Files\Kodi\system\players\dsplayer\LAVFilters&lt;/span&gt;, replacing files at the destination.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the nVidia control panel, disable stereoscopic 3D. With the current drivers, enabling it causes crashes in
        madVR when Direct3D 11 is enabled and it goes full screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have HDR and Advanced Color disabled in the Windows 10 display settings. MadVR enables it during playback as
        needed, and it makes the desktop look bad when it&apos;s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In Plex for Kodi Settings, enable HEVC streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the LG OLED TV settings, disable Screen Shift. This setting shifts the image around by 1 pixel every few
        minutes, which will result in the line-interlaced image output by madVR not being aligned with the FPR (3D
        filter), which results in the left and right eyes being swapped. Note this will increase the risk of image
        retention.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MadVR settings (just the required stuff, other settings you should probably mess with, lots of other guides on
        that):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;rendering -&amp;gt; general settings: Use Direct3D 11 for presentation (required for 10-bit color output)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;rendering -&amp;gt; stereo 3D: enable stereo 3D playback. Leave everything else unchecked.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Devices -&amp;gt; &lt;your avr=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; tv=&quot;&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; properties: the native display bitdepth is 10 bit or higher

                passive displays like LG OLEDs, *not* for any other kind of display)&lt;/your&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Devices -&amp;gt; &lt;your avr=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; tv=&quot;&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; hdr: passthrough HDR content to the display, and send HDR

Rafael Miguel and Matthew Smolich had a homework assignment for religion class at
Christian Brothers High School. The assignment was to imagine a new Catholic religious order and create a brochure for
it. Real examples of such orders include the&amp;nbsp;De La Salle Brothers (who started our high school), Franciscans and
Dominicans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each order focuses on a particular &quot;charism&quot;, which essentially is a gift of a skill granted by
God to individuals that they can go out and help others. Rafa and Matt envisioned an order called The Cookie Krank House
which helped others through making and selling cookies. At some point they got help from Matthew Braly to do the
drawings fro the brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teacher grading the assignment did not appreciate it. She claimed that &quot;Krank
House&quot; was synonymous with &quot;crack house&quot;, which is clearly not an appropriate thing to call a monastery. She gave Rafa
and Matt an F on the assignment. I personally couldn&apos;t disagree more with the grade. Cookie Monster appearing in monk&apos;s
robes with full crazy eyes alone deserves an A. But you can judge for yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;

Rafael Miguel and Matthew Smolich had a homework assignment for religion class at Christian Brothers High School. The assignment was to imagine a new Catholic religious order and create a brochure for it. Real examples of such orders include the&amp;nbsp;De La Salle Brothers (who started our high school), Franciscans and Dominicans.Each order focuses on a particular &quot;charism&quot;, which essentially is a gift of a skill granted by God to individuals that they can go out and help others. Rafa and Matt envisioned an order called The Cookie Krank House which helped others through making and selling cookies. At some point they got help from Matthew Braly to do the drawings fro the brochure.The teacher grading the assignment did not appreciate it. She claimed that &quot;Krank House&quot; was synonymous with &quot;crack house&quot;, which is clearly not an appropriate thing to call a monastery. She gave Rafa and Matt an F on the assignment. I personally couldn&apos;t disagree more with the grade. Cookie Monster appearing in monk&apos;s robes with full crazy eyes alone deserves an A. But you can judge for yourselves.

I think getting it has not been and will not be
worth the costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Some background on my situation: I am getting my degree from Stanford in Computer Science. I have worked at Google
    the whole time. I&apos;ve taken 15 classes (10 weeks each) over 5 years. No research or thesis, just classes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to get a degree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These are the main reasons I can think of to get a degree and why they&apos;re not good enough reasons for me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To gain useful skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Many people think one learns skills in school which can be used to do useful stuff outside of school. My
    objections:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Degrees are like a cable package&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To get my degree, I had to take 15 classes and I had limited freedom in choosing those 15. Of course each class is
    itself a bundle of topics, and I have no freedom to choose what topics get covered in each class. Sticking with the
    cable TV analogy, this is like having to watch an entire week&apos;s worth of a TV channel. I estimate at least 1/3 of
    the material I learned was totally useless for me. And as for the remaining 2/3, see the next point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I forget things that I don&apos;t use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is a lesson that I should have learned very early in this whole process. Stanford requires master&apos;s students
    who don&apos;t have a bachelor&apos;s from Stanford to take certain &quot;foundation&quot; undergraduate level CS classes to complete
    the master&apos;s degree.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One&apos;s adviser has the power to waive these requirements. I looked over the list of foundation requirements and
    thought &quot;I took all those classes already in undergrad, no need to take them again&quot;. So I went into my adviser&apos;s
    office and asked him to waive the requirements. He responded by verbally quizzing me on the spot about several of
    the topics. I miserably failed to recall basic details of these classes that I had gotten A&apos;s in a few years before.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At that point, it had been 2 years since I finished my bachelor&apos;s in CS, and I had been working full-time as a
    software engineer since then, yet &lt;b&gt;I hadn&apos;t used any of the stuff, so I forgot most of it pretty thoroughly&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since then I&apos;ve become ever more skeptical that it&apos;s useful to take classes now in the hopes of using the knowledge
    several years down the road. Maybe it will be useful some day, but if it&apos;s not any time soon, I may as well not have
    taken the class at all. My brain just doesn&apos;t work that way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To signal personal qualities to employers&lt;/h3&gt;There&apos;s a lot of evidence that employers value people with degrees not
because of the useful skills one gains in school, but because the completion of the degree shows one has certain
personal qualities: intelligence, perseverance, cooperativeness, conformity, etc. For more on this evidence, check out
this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/04/bryan_caplan_on.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awesome episode of
    EconTalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that employers think this way and thus degrees have some value. However in my
particular case, I already had a job at one of the most sought-after companies in my field. Even if I were to switch
companies but stay in software engineering, I&apos;m skeptical many employers would care about my degree now that I have 7
years of job experience from well-regarded companies. However I grant that this is an empirical question and I could
very well be proven wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the love of learning&lt;/h3&gt;I often enjoy learning new things, but doing it on someone else&apos;s schedule can be very
stressful. Over the course of my degree, I had more than one occassion where I had to stay up all night to finish a
shcool assignment and then I had a regular work day ahead of me. Even when I got to bed at a reasonable hour, doing all
the school work on nights and weekends after working a full work day / week really killed a lot of the fun for me. Also,
learning with other people is more fun than learning alone, but because I did the degree part-time and mostly
off-campus, I didn&apos;t get much contact with other students. Which brings me to the next point...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To meet people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I didn&apos;t get to meet many other students or hang out with the ones I did meet because I did my degree part-time,
    remotely and while working full time. This is in stark contrast to my undergrad experience, where I formed wonderful
    long-lasting relationships with people who I took classes with or who were just around campus or in the same dorm at
    the same time that I was.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to not get a degree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;My degree cost about $54,000 in tuition. My employer paid for
        most of it, but I still paid for some of it and honestly I&apos;d rather my employer used the money on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href=&quot;https://www.google.com/loon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;project loon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Because I was studying, I had less time for sleep, exercise, work, friends and family. These things are all
    extremely valuable to me. Given all my above objections, it should be clear I think most of the time I spent getting
    this degree would have been better spent on one of those other things. Now that I&apos;m almost done, I&apos;m not at all
    excited about how much knowledge or prestige I will have. I&apos;m excited that I&apos;ll have more time to spend on more
    important things.&lt;/div&gt;

am passionate about.&lt;br /&gt;I started transcribing around 54 minutes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott Sumner:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&apos;s
this perception that housing was really overbuilt... during the housing boom. And you know that&apos;s certainly true in some
locations. But the data doesn&apos;t really tend to support that. Rents have been rising, actually fairly rapidly in recent
decades... faster than people&apos;s incomes in many cases. And people that invest in rental apartments have done very very
well in recent years. And one of the reasons for that is that there&apos;s a lot of restrictions on building now, so building
since 2008 has been at very low levels, and yet the population continues to grow. So people are going more and more into
rental units, they&apos;re having difficulty getting mortgages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that part of the real estate sector, rental
units, is doing very well, and rents are rising and in many of the most prosperous parts of the country, you can
actually argue that there&apos;s too little housing because of regulations that make it difficult to build, and so that
pushes up prices and rents in those areas. So again we have a market that&apos;s kind of complex and I think the story that
people focused on a few years ago was the over building in a few locations, but nation-wide you could argue that we
actually aren&apos;t building enough housing, and as a result, the costs are going up, which means the returns to land lords
in New York City and California and so on are actually very high right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russ Roberts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And
home owners generally, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, they get an implicit, you know, rent on the... And
they may profit if the price of their home goes up in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which they have
dramatically, in many of them. And ... you raise a great point, which is the restriction on supply part of this story.
It depresses me greatly when people say things like, &quot;We need to build some low-income housing in such and such a city&quot;
or &quot;We need to have more opportunities for the middle class to have comfortable places to live.&quot; Well, in New York, in
any city, again take the two places that, I&apos;ll take the three that I have some acquaintance with, New York, Washington
and California. These are three places where it&apos;s very expensive to live if you&apos;re a young person starting out in your
life and you&apos;d like to either own a house, or just rent an apartment. And the question is why, because it wasn&apos;t always?
And people say things like, &quot;Well, California has great weather&quot;. Well, it had great weather in 1962. &quot;New York&apos;s a
great city&quot;. It was a great city in 1960. It had some issues, yes. But why is it that as these places have grown in
their attractiveness, the mix of housing has, I suspect, moved greatly toward the high-end. And, uh, that I think is due
to regulation. And it&apos;s a terrible result, and capitalism or markets get blamed. &quot;The market doesn&apos;t produce low income
housing, middle-income housing, it only produces high-end.&quot; Well there&apos;s a reason for that, there&apos;s a reason it&apos;s so
profitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of people on the left don&apos;t fully realize how much of some of
the issues they worry about is actually driven by regulation. One is inequality. And I&apos;m working on an article on that
topic right now. But also this investment question we were looking at may be part of it as well. And it&apos;s just a lot
harder to get approval for all sorts of building projects. One is you know the housing, as we&apos;ve been talking
about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even things that people on the left tend to favor, you know, government projects, like high speed
rail. In Massachusetts they fought endlessly to build a wind farm off the cost. Well these days these get tied up in the
courts forever, and it&apos;s very hard to get a project actually built. A major, like, infrastructure project of that
sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the increasing complexity of regulation, land restrictions, environmental rules and so-on,
it&apos;s just harder for us to have the sort of economy we had in the 1960s where we just build highways and housing
developments all across the country whenever there was a demand for it in a certain location. And you know, there are
costs of that. One is there&apos;s less investment in the economy. I would argue it worsens inequality in a number of ways as
well. It&apos;s hurting renters right now, relative to home-owners. But that&apos;s something I think people on the left don&apos;t
fully recognize when they think about the effects of regulation. They don&apos;t think about the connection with inequality.
...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just in Israel for two weeks. They have security issues of course, but on
the domestic side the thing people are most worried about is the price of food and housing. There have been protests in
the street. Netanyahu almost lost this last election because of his failure to do anything about it. He&apos;s made lots of
pledges, he&apos;s going to fix it. But the reason that there&apos;s a food and housing crisis in Israel is pretty straight
forward. There&apos;s a lot of barriers to importing food and to creating retailing in food, so food&apos;s really expensive.
There are cartels, literally, in some parts of food supply that keep the food price high, and growing. And that&apos;s,
that&apos;s easily fixed if you wanted to, but politically it may be very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with housing, the
government owns a lot of the housing, a lot of the land in Israel. And to the extent that it doesn&apos;t, it makes it hard
to use it privately. So, recently I was talking to a guy who&apos;s building a house. He said it&apos;s going to take 3 and a half
years. When I told that story to someone else, he laughed, he said &quot;Oh, he &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; it&apos;s going to take three and
half years. Now, when it takes maybe half a decade to build a house, you&apos;re pretty confident that rental prices are
going to be pretty high in a growing economy. Which is your point. And one way to quantify that would be to try to see
how much longer it takes to build a house in Israel today than say ten or twenty years ago. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s
changed. It may have gotten a little bit shorter, but in the face of growing demand, it may be off set by
that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And similarly in the United States, when we talk about regulation in real estate, which is enormous in
major urban areas, I&apos;d like to see some measures: how long does it take? How many bureaucracies do you have to go
through? We&apos;re still much better than Israel, but I&apos;d say we&apos;re probably still in the ball-park. Maybe it&apos;s not the
three and half year thing to build a house, but I assume if you wanted to start a real estate development in New York,
it&apos;s a major political investment. And as you say, that rewards high-end, large firms. And if you&apos;re going to have to
incur a large fixed cost, you&apos;re probably going to build on the higher-end. So I assume that&apos;s a part of the problem.
That&apos;s a story, I&apos;d like to see some evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, there&apos;s actually quite a bit of
evidence that the cost is large. One piece is that in places like Los Angeles, if you have say a ten thousand square
foot piece of land that is zoned for 2 units rather than 1 unit, it&apos;s worth vastly more money in the market place. And
so that gives you a pretty good estimate of what that particular zoning rule, if it is only zoned for one unit, it tells
you that zoning rule is costing quite a bit of money. In the hundreds of thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...
Real estate, and the cost of renting, or the return to home owners who already own homes. And their ability to use the
political process to protect those investments seems to me to be a really big problem, that doesn&apos;t get enough
attention.</content><author><name>garymm</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">An excerpt from EconTalk&amp;nbsp;on an issue I am passionate about.I started transcribing around 54 minutes in.Scott Sumner:So there&apos;s this perception that housing was really overbuilt... during the housing boom. And you know that&apos;s certainly true in some locations. But the data doesn&apos;t really tend to support that. Rents have been rising, actually fairly rapidly in recent decades... faster than people&apos;s incomes in many cases. And people that invest in rental apartments have done very very well in recent years. And one of the reasons for that is that there&apos;s a lot of restrictions on building now, so building since 2008 has been at very low levels, and yet the population continues to grow. So people are going more and more into rental units, they&apos;re having difficulty getting mortgages.So that part of the real estate sector, rental units, is doing very well, and rents are rising and in many of the most prosperous parts of the country, you can actually argue that there&apos;s too little housing because of regulations that make it difficult to build, and so that pushes up prices and rents in those areas. So again we have a market that&apos;s kind of complex and I think the story that people focused on a few years ago was the over building in a few locations, but nation-wide you could argue that we actually aren&apos;t building enough housing, and as a result, the costs are going up, which means the returns to land lords in New York City and California and so on are actually very high right now.Russ Roberts:And home owners generally, right?Scott:Yeah, they get an implicit, you know, rent on the... And they may profit if the price of their home goes up in those areas.Russ:Which they have dramatically, in many of them.

Kinakuta:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Perhaps I can make an analogy to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)&quot;
        target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;... At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged in a pattern that is simple and
    easy to understand. The players make small decisions, one turn at a time, each decision fairly simple in and of
    itself, and made for reasons that can be easily understood, even by a &amp;nbsp;novice. But over the course of many such
    turns, the pattern develops such great complexity that only the finest minds... can comprehend it... The analogy is
    clear. Our policies concerning free speech, telecommunications, and cryptography have evolved from a series of
    simple, rational decisions. But they are today so complex that no one can understand them, even in one single
    country, to say nothing of all countries taken together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Next, Larry Page, CEO of Google, in response to a question &quot;What would be
government 2.0 in your mind?&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;I do worry that when I look at... our interactions with governments or the things we get
    interested in, you know spectrum or whatever, that it becomes pretty illogical. And I think the reasons aren&apos;t that
    the people aren&apos;t good and that they&apos;re not trying to do good things. I mean most people you talk to in government,
    you know, are in there for the right reasons, they&apos;re not there for the pay, typically. They&apos;re there because they
    want to make the world better. But I think the set of rules that we have... One thing that I would observe is that
    the complexity of government increases over time. So you just look at all of our democracies around the world... The
    amount of regulation and law that we have, increases without bound.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;So I was trying to reduce the complexity in Google. I was thinking, we&apos;re getting to be a
    bigger company, let&apos;s take our rules and regulations, let&apos;s ... make sure they stay at fifty pages, so that people
    can actually read it. But the problem that I discovered about that was that by reference we include the entire law
    and regulation of the entire world. Because we&apos;re a multinational company, we operate everywhere, our employees,
    what they do affects everything and so in some sense we&apos;d have to read the 100 million pages of law and regulation
    that are out there....&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first quote is from a novel published in 1999: &lt;a
