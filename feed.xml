&lt;p&gt;I had my first child when I was 36 years old, which made me want to understand the risks of having children at different ages. Before looking into this, my impression was that the main biological problems with old-age parenthood had to do with not having the necessary health and vigor to care for young’uns, and I had heard that older women have trouble getting pregnant. While those are real issues, there are many others worthy of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My read of the evidence is that the risks of miscarriage and serious health problems for children, including autism and birth defects, increase significantly with parental (both paternal and maternal) age. The data I could find for most risks is not very fine-grained and not very precise, but I think this qualitative description matches the data: Risks start rising at around 30 years old for both mothers and fathers, rises gradually through about 35 for mothers and 40 for fathers, and then sharply after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the ages at which things start to go wrong are similar for fathers and mothers, but the mechanisms are different. Sperm cells are produced throughout a man’s life, and each time a new cell is produced, there is a chance of a genetic mutation. Sperm are produced by copying the DNA of other short-lived cells, which are themselves produced in the same way, so mutations accumulate. Women’s egg cells, however, are all present when a woman is born, but over time they accumulate damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is correct, then there are two ways to reduce these risks: have kids when young, or use frozen gametes from your younger selves. If you’re already in the danger zone and don’t have frozen gametes, pre-implantation genetic testing may be able to screen out embryos that have certain genetic defects, and thus reduce the risk of some bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to have kids at some later age, and that later age is &amp;gt;= 35 for a woman or &amp;gt;= 40 for a man, freeze your gametes ASAP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re already past those age thresholds and you have the means, consider in-vitro fertilization so you can take advantage of pre-implantation genetic testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “the dangers” section below I summarize some evidence on how parental age interacts with various risks. What’s not obvious is the relationship between the different risks. That is, are they mostly independent of each other, or is a child born with e.g., a heart defect much more likely to be autistic? They are not independent. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2006181&quot;&gt;Eide et al.&lt;/a&gt; find a significant correlation between birth defects and intellectual disability. So if you want to know “what are the odds my kid comes out totally healthy”, I think just looking at the highest risk and ignoring the others is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in the details supporting the above conclusions, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-jargon&quot;&gt;Technical jargon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skip this if you know these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prevalence&quot;&gt;Prevalence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence is what fraction of the population has the outcome of interest. Basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(number of people with the outcome) / (number of people that were studied).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;odds-ratio&quot;&gt;Odds ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An odds ratio is a ratio of how likely the outcome of interest is in the condition of interest, to how likely it is in some reference condition. For the data below, the condition is always a particular parental age range, and the reference condition is some other age range that the researchers chose. For example, say we set the reference age to 25, and our outcome of interest is being born with green hair. If a study finds that children of fathers aged 30 have 1/10 odds of being born with green hair, and the children of fathers aged 25 have 1/100 odds of being born with green hair, then the odds ratio for age 30 is 1/10 / 1 / 100 = 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;95-ci&quot;&gt;95% CI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 95% CI (confidence interval) is a range of values. Under certain assumptions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there is a 95% chance that the true value falls within that range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-implantation-genetic-testing&quot;&gt;Pre-implantation genetic testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-implantation genetic testing is done on embryos that have been fertilized in-vitro before implanting them into a woman (more details &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yT22RcWrxZcXyGjsA/how-to-have-polygenically-screened-children#But_how_do_they_even_get_an_embryo_s_DNA_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). After developing for about 10 days, embryos have enough cells that some can be removed for genetic testing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9674466/&quot;&gt;Sordia-Hernandez et al.&lt;/a&gt; look at the effects of testing for aneuploidy, which is a specific kind of genetic defect which often results in miscarriage or abortion. It finds significant benefits for women &amp;gt;= 35 years old, but not for younger women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for almost everything else, the outcome being tested for is bad, whereas here it is live birth rate, or the odds of a child being born alive after an embryo is transferred into a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother’s age&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live birth rate odds ratio 95% CI (relative to no genetic testing)&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt; 35
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;0.56, 1.34
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= 35
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1.07, 2.84
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very recently, some companies have started offering more in-depth genetic screening for embryos, such as sequencing the whole genome and assessing risk for polygenic traits, meaning influenced by many genes. The companies offering this service claim all sorts of benefits, such as reducing the risk of cancer and diabetes, but I don’t think it’s been independently evaluated, and it’s probably too new to truly evaluate, since there’s a very small number of people alive who were screened in this way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yT22RcWrxZcXyGjsA/how-to-have-polygenically-screened-children&quot;&gt;Here’s Gene Smith’s post&lt;/a&gt; that’s very enthusiastic about such screening and tells you how to go about it, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yT22RcWrxZcXyGjsA/how-to-have-polygenically-screened-children?commentId=uiFXXRpdXCzXjmfj8&quot;&gt;my response trying to summarize a skeptical position&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re older and you don’t have frozen gametes, should you do IVF just so you can do pre-implantation genetic testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very effective at detecting aneuploidy, and thus increasing live birth rate per pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can choose the child’s sex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you opt for whole-genome sequencing, it is possible to reduce other health risks and possibly improve other desirable traits like IQ. Again, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yT22RcWrxZcXyGjsA/how-to-have-polygenically-screened-children&quot;&gt;Gene Smith’s post&lt;/a&gt; for more details on this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I haven’t seen any strong evidence that IVF results in worse health outcomes. Note there are many studies that show worse outcomes for IVF, but since IVF is largely used by people who have fertility problems, and differences seem to disappear entirely when controlling for this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650450/&quot;&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expensive in time and money (maybe $25,000 in 2023).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will be more expensive and / or less effective for women who produce fewer eggs per retrieval, which is mostly older women.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/25/2/137/5316072?login=false&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that IVF results in differences in the embryo that might possibly result in less healthy people (vs old-fashioned conception). I think the odds that this results in worse outcomes are quite low, but it’s worth mentioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dangers&quot;&gt;The dangers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;miscarriage&quot;&gt;Miscarriage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l869&quot;&gt;Magnus et al.&lt;/a&gt; shows the absolute risk by mother’s age. Y-axis is the proportion of pregnancies that end in miscarriage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-11-10-the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old/maternal-miscarriage-780-b27867d53.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;absolute risk of miscarriage by maternal age&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-11-10-the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old/maternal-miscarriage-400-902027773.webp 400w, /generated/2023-11-10-the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old/maternal-miscarriage-600-902027773.webp 600w, /generated/2023-11-10-the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old/maternal-miscarriage-780-902027773.webp 780w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s some data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456349/&quot;&gt;du Fossé et al.&lt;/a&gt; on the risk by father’s age. For the absolute risk, I assumed the absolute risk for the reference age is 10%, which seems to be about the value for a 27 year old woman from the chart above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;autism&quot;&gt;Autism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prevalence-1&quot;&gt;Prevalence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with a huge range of abilities and tendencies are all diagnosed with autism, and there’s a lot of debate about the accuracy of many diagnoses. However “profound autism” is a diagnosis with much clearer criteria. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370128310_The_Prevalence_and_Characteristics_of_Children_With_Profound_Autism_15_Sites_United_States_2000-2016&quot;&gt;Hughes et al.&lt;/a&gt; defined profound autism “as children with autism who were either nonverbal or minimally verbal or had an (intelligence quotient) IQ &amp;lt;50”. That study estimated the prevalence of profound autism in the USA as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Female
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1.88 / 1000 = 1 / 532
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Male
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;7.18 / 1000 = 1 / 139
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Overall
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4.59 / 1000 = 1 / 218
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers seem shockingly high, but they do somewhat match my casual observations. I don’t know a lot of children, but I know of at least 2 profoundly autistic boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-by-parental-age&quot;&gt;Risk by parental age&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies I found on the impact of parental age did not restrict themselves to just profound autism, so it’s possible that parental age interacts with profound autism differently, but my guess is it’s at least qualitatively correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2638544/&quot;&gt;Durkin et al.&lt;/a&gt;, who looked at both the father’s and mother’s ages. For the absolute risk for fathers, I used the number of autism spectrum disorder cases / size of the “Birth Chort Comparison Group” for the father’s or mother’s reference age, extracted from table 3 of the paper. For fathers that’s 322 / 67,080 = 0.48%. For mother’s that’s 366 / 75,053 = 0.49%. These numbers are close to the overall risk of profound autism from Hughes et al. above, but this study considered any autism diagnosis, so something is probably wrong either with my calculation or with one or both of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Father’s age&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note from paper: “Because the increased risk was similar for ages 35–39 and ≥40 years, the high-risk maternal age category was defined as ≥35 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2010.121&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; that looked only at the father’s age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chromosome-disorders&quot;&gt;Chromosome disorders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prevalence-2&quot;&gt;Prevalence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9934980/&quot;&gt;Caron, Tihy, and Dallaire&lt;/a&gt; find that of mothers aged &amp;gt;= 35,  1.79% or 1 / 55 have a chromosomal disorder in the second trimester. Note that some chromosome disorders result in miscarriage earlier than that, so the true prevalence is certainly higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-by-parental-age-1&quot;&gt;Risk by parental age&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compute absolute risk, I took the prevalence number from above and then divided it by 5.66 (the middle of the odds ratio CI for mothers aged &amp;gt;= 35) to get 1.79 % / 5.66 = 0.32%.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the official MLFlow server and client are written in Python, such an integration test would involve multiple languages. Bazel made it easy to set up and automate a multi-language test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazel is a build tool and test runner. There’s lots to love about Bazel, but in this case the useful things are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It supports many programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Its “data” and “runfiles” features enable one Bazel target to access other build outputs at run-time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can automatically download all needed language compilers / runtimes and external dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why I wanted an integration test, I need to explain a little about the system under test. The client logs to and reads from a local file system. In a unit test, I can assert that the client is able to write and read back what it wrote, but I can’t assert that the files are in a format that the official MLFlow code will understand, since there is no specification of the file format. The fact that I can read my own handwriting is pretty useless if I’m writing you a letter and you can’t read it. A test that uses both the Go and Python client libraries can enforce compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s pseudo-code&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the test I ended up writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for client_binary in (go, py):
  temp_dir := make_temp_dir()
  run client binary in a subprocess, pointing it to write to temp_dir
  use official MLFlow client library to read from temp_dir
  assert we read what we expect to read
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test is declared in a BUILD.bazel file&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Let’s walk through what’s in it. First we declare the binaries that write to MLFlow, using the Go and Python client libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# go binary that uses our go client
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;go_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;go&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;srcs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;main.go&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;//:mlflow&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# python binary that uses the official client
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;srcs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;main.py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;main.py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@pip//mlflow:pkg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we declare the test, which depends on the above binaries as data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;conformance_test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;srcs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;conformance_test.py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;:go&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;:py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@pip//mlflow:pkg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@rules_python//python/runfiles&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field in the conformance_test target means bazel will build those targets when it builds the test, and the test can access them at run-time. To access them, we use Bazel’s runfiles module. In my conformance_test, to access the “py” target I would write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;python.runfiles.runfiles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# converts relative path to absolute path
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;binary_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runfiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runfiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rlocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conformance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the documentation for runfiles in Bazel is currently pretty bad (as it is for many topics), but the basic workflow is:
Add the target for what you want to access at runtime (which can be a built binary, in this case our “py” and “go” targets) to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field of the accessor’s target declaration (in this case the “conformance_test”).
In the accessor’s code (in this case conformance_test.py), use a Bazel runfiles library to access the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically the “rules_&amp;lt;lang&amp;gt;” module that provides Bazel support for a given language includes a library to access runfiles. The one I used in my python test is “@rules_python//python/runfiles”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above I mentioned Bazel’s dependency management. In this case, the only thing a user needs to install is bazel. Then when the user runs &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bazel test //conformance:conformance_test&lt;/code&gt;, bazel will:
Download a specific version of the Go toolchain (compiler and linker)
Download a specific version of the Python interpreter
Download all external Go and Python dependencies
Use the above to build the needed targets
Runs the test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Let me know if you find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post I’ll explain why I think you should consider visiting and address some common reasons people don’t go, including safety. This is not a travel guide, but I’ll provide a few recommendations for where to go and a few tips for how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-stuff&quot;&gt;The good stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-people-coming-from-the-usa&quot;&gt;For people coming from the USA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s close! There are lots of flights, and they’re not too long. E.g., flying from San Francisco to Mexico City takes 4.5 hours. And the time zones are similar, meaning less jet lag, and it’s easy to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-everyone&quot;&gt;For everyone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relatively-affordable&quot;&gt;Relatively affordable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://businessblog.trivago.com/trivago-hotel-price-index/&quot;&gt;Trivago Hotel Price Index&lt;/a&gt; says the average hotel room in Mexico City in 2023-03 is $110 ($249 in San Francisco, $258 in Paris). A seven-course tasting menu with drinks at the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/travel/criollo-oaxaca-elrique-olvera-restaurant-review.html&quot;&gt;Criollo&lt;/a&gt; in Oaxaca costs less than $50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;loads-of-history&quot;&gt;Loads of history&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parts of Mexico feel storied in the same way places in Europe or Asia do, but that’s relatively rare in other parts of the Americas. You can climb on the ruins of cities that were at their peak hundreds of years before the Spanish conquest, and engage with a culture that is descended from the ones that built those cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-food&quot;&gt;Great food&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had several friends move from California to Europe and cite Mexican food as the main thing they miss. And the Mexican food in California is not nearly as good as the food in Mexico! You can eat extremely well on the street, in a market stall, or in fancy restaurants associated with internationally renowned chefs. If you want to cook for yourself, there is fresh and cheap produce available at open-air markets, supermarkets, or even Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;warm-weather&quot;&gt;Warm weather&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love going to Mexico during the winter. It’s a big country with a varied climate, but hardly any place is actually cold during the winter. The average high temp in Mexico City is 22°C / 71°F in January and 25°C / 77°F in June. Many coastal areas are warm enough that swimming is extremely pleasant year-round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;friendly-people&quot;&gt;Friendly people&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexicans are very open and welcoming to foreigners. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/2022/best-and-worst-places-for-expats-40242&quot;&gt;survey of expats by InterNations&lt;/a&gt; found Mexico “comes first in the Local Friendliness, Finding Friends, and Culture &amp;amp; Welcome Subcategories. Expats describe the local residents as friendly (90% vs. 66% globally) and find it easy to make friends among them (75% vs. 42% globally).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bad-stuff-is-not-too-bad&quot;&gt;The bad stuff (is not too bad)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some aspects of Mexico that are not ideal, but there are ways to mitigate those issues. For me, the major ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safety&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Air Pollution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-avoid-the-violent-places-and-wear-a-seat-belt&quot;&gt;Safety: avoid the violent places and wear a seat-belt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent crime is very bad in some parts of Mexico, but it’s easy to avoid those parts. Road accidents get less press but I think are actually a larger danger for most tourists. Here are some tips for staying safe from both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;road-accidents&quot;&gt;Road accidents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nearest brush with death in Mexico came as I was driving on a freeway at night when a herd of cattle emerged from the desert onto the road in front of me without warning. Luckily I was driving slowly enough to stop with plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do the following to reduce your risk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have a choice between a free (“libre”) and a toll (“cuota”) road, pay the toll. The road will be much better maintained and your journey will take less time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimize time spent on the road at night, especially in poorly lit (rural) areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimize time spent in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mexicorelocationguide.com/colectivo/&quot;&gt;colectivos&lt;/a&gt; (vans that operate as public transit). They’re fun and cheap, but rarely do riders get to wear seat belts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often the seat belt buckles will be stuffed underneath the seat cushions. Take the time to pull them out and fasten yourself in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell your driver (via a translation app if necessary) to slow down if they’re driving too fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;#road-accidents-data&quot;&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt; has some data on road accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;violent-crime&quot;&gt;Violent crime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent crime is much worse in Mexico than in many other places. However, it is very unevenly distributed, and there are locations that should be safe enough for all but the paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you look at the homicide rates for any place you’re considering visiting.
I suggest looking at homicide rates because homicide likely has the most accurate official statistics of any crime (one reason is that deaths are frequently tabulated by different agencies (e.g., the coroner) than the ones responsible for crime statistics, so there are multiple independent data sources), and it probably correlates strongly with other violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a map from &lt;a href=&quot;https://elcri.men/en/cluster-map/&quot;&gt;El Crimen&lt;/a&gt;, where brighter means more homicide:
&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/homicide-cluster-map-800-7739fe512.png&quot; alt=&quot;homicide cluster map&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/homicide-cluster-map-400-0145fb608.webp 400w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/homicide-cluster-map-600-0145fb608.webp 600w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/homicide-cluster-map-800-0145fb608.webp 800w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/homicide-cluster-map-1000-0145fb608.webp 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the brightest spots is Guaymas, Sonora, which has a homicide rate of 115 / 100k population.
That’s way more murdery than I would be comfortable with, but just avoid the bright spots and you’ll probably be fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some homicide rates in a few cities in Mexico that I recommend in green, compared with some cities in the USA and France you might be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/city-homicides-2020-800-7d1c3075c.png&quot; alt=&quot;homicide rates in different cities (2020)&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/city-homicides-2020-400-a8f5ab7b7.webp 400w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/city-homicides-2020-600-a8f5ab7b7.webp 600w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/city-homicides-2020-800-a8f5ab7b7.webp 800w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/city-homicides-2020-1000-a8f5ab7b7.webp 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see the city with the highest homicide rate that I’ve recommended is Oaxaca, which has a rate significantly less than Washington DC. In both Washington DC and Oaxaca I think the places a tourist is likely to visit are very safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;#crime-data&quot;&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt; has details on the data sources and some more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-pollution&quot;&gt;Air Pollution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air pollution in Mexico City is bad enough that it would deter me from living there long term. However, most places in Mexico have much cleaner air than Mexico City, and even there the air is clean enough that I’m entirely comfortable visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iqair.com/&quot;&gt;IQAir&lt;/a&gt; to check air quality before your trip. For any particular station, scroll down to the “historical” section to get a feel for the typical values. You can look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-cities&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to see annual average data for different cities across the world. If I were going to Mexico City or another place with sometimes-bad-air, I would take an N95 mask just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;language&quot;&gt;Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have personal experience with this issue because I speak Spanish pretty well. My guess is that life as as an English speaker is a bit easier than in e.g., Thailand, but harder than in e.g., Switzerland. Everything is written in a Latin script, which makes it easy to read and type in to your phone. There are English-speaking guides available for hire outside many tourist attractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Translate works quite well between English and Spanish, and it can translate text from photos you take with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-go&quot;&gt;Where to go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not the only places worth going to. These are some of the places that I have visited myself. For each place I note a few highlights to get you excited and get you started on your trip planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yucatán-state-w&quot;&gt;Yucatán state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n&quot;&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance of culture and nature. Pre-columbian ruins (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza&quot;&gt;Chichén Itzá&lt;/a&gt;), beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote&quot;&gt;cenotes&lt;/a&gt; (pools in limestone caves where you can swim), excellent birding (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADa_Lagartos_Biosphere_Reserve&quot;&gt;Ría Lagartos&lt;/a&gt;), great food (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquesita&quot;&gt;marquesitas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seriouseats.com/sikil-paak-from-yucatan&quot;&gt;sikil paak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panucho&quot;&gt;panuchos&lt;/a&gt;), and the safe, walkable and charming capital city, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Yucat%C3%A1n&quot;&gt;Mérida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/chichen-itza-800-9ed8e09f3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chichen itza in Yucatán state&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/chichen-itza-400-5b4b1cd65.webp 400w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/chichen-itza-600-5b4b1cd65.webp 600w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/chichen-itza-800-5b4b1cd65.webp 800w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/chichen-itza-1000-5b4b1cd65.webp 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chichén Itzá. Not my favorite Mayan ruin, but perhaps the most photogenic. Credit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CoaimXmprgu/&quot;&gt;visitmeridamx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baja-california-sur-w&quot;&gt;Baja California Sur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur&quot;&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low on culture, high on nature. Release newly hatched sea turtles (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todos_Santos,_Baja_California_Sur&quot;&gt;Todos Santos&lt;/a&gt;), get really close to mother and child whales (in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ignacio_Lagoon&quot;&gt;San Ignacio Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;), kayak and swim with seals and dolphins (e.g., near &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreto,_Baja_California_Sur&quot;&gt;Loreto&lt;/a&gt;), hike in the desert to find prehistoric petroglyphs, snorkel, SCUBA dive, or surf. If you want to stay at a fancy resort, there are lots of those in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Cabos_Municipality&quot;&gt;Los Cabos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High on culture, low on nature. Pre-columbian ruins (both in the middle of the city e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_Mayor&quot;&gt;Templo Mayor&lt;/a&gt; and just outside in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan&quot;&gt;Teotihuacán&lt;/a&gt;), amazing architecture (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_de_Correos_de_M%C3%A9xico&quot;&gt;Postal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Universitaria,_Mexico_City&quot;&gt;University City&lt;/a&gt;), great museums (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Anthropology_(Mexico)&quot;&gt;National Museum of Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/palacio-de-cultura-banamex-m%C3%A9xico&quot;&gt;Palacio de Cultura Banamex&lt;/a&gt;), religious pilgrimage sites (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe&quot;&gt;Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe&lt;/a&gt;), fancy restaurants (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contramar.com.mx/&quot;&gt;Contramar&lt;/a&gt;), food from every region of Mexico, and excellent Lebanese food (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opentable.com/r/al-andalus-san-angel-ciudad-de-mexico&quot;&gt;Al Andalus&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-tips&quot;&gt;General tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visit-big-cities-during-christmas-or-easter&quot;&gt;Visit big cities during Christmas or Easter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider visiting big cities during the winter (Christmas - New Year) or spring (Holy Week) holidays, when air pollution (and traffic) tend to be much lighter because many fewer people are driving to work. However these are not the best times to visit beaches and other tourist destinations, because they’ll be full of domestic tourists from the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seek-out-something-very-local&quot;&gt;Seek out something very local&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had fun by seeking out very specific local experiences. Some that I’ve enjoyed that you might too: spot a type of bird you find beautiful, visit a studio that makes some handicraft you like and talk to the artisans, drink a hard-to-find local drink, try all the tortillerias within walking distance of your hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-internet&quot;&gt;Use the internet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy a cheap SIM in the airport, or get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://esimdb.com/mexico&quot;&gt;eSIM&lt;/a&gt; before leaving home. 3G coverage is pretty widespread (though not ubiquitous in very rural areas away from major roads) and 4G is very good in all cities and major highways (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telcel.com/mundo_telcel/quienes-somos/corporativo/mapas-cobertura&quot;&gt;here’s the coverage map&lt;/a&gt; for Telcel, one of the carriers with the widest coverage)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed-line internet is fast and widely available in cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is ubiquitous. To message somebody via WhatsApp without adding them to your contacts first, open &lt;a href=&quot;https://wa.me/&quot;&gt;https://wa.me/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;phone number with country code no plus&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Maps has accurate locations and many reviews by locals for almost all attractions. Pro tip: When reading a restaurant review that’s been translated from Spanish to English, be aware that Google consistently mistranslates the word “rico” to “rich”, rather than the correct “delicious”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/google-maps-translation-744-166db6e61.png&quot; alt=&quot;google maps bad translation&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/google-maps-translation-400-f7567ed96.webp 400w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/google-maps-translation-600-f7567ed96.webp 600w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/google-maps-translation-744-f7567ed96.webp 744w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber is cheap and works very well in the cities where it’s available. Uber Eats delivers from restaurants and grocers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;see-also&quot;&gt;See also&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often use the Lonely Planet guides as a starting point to plan a trip. I use it to narrow down potential areas to visit, and then I switch to researching online for detailed planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn about the history of civilization in Mexico and how it fits into the world, I highly recommend Charles Mann’s books “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1491:_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus&quot;&gt;1491&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1493:_Uncovering_the_New_World_Columbus_Created&quot;&gt;1493&lt;/a&gt;”. Neither is exclusively about Mexico, but both feature it heavily, and you can use the index to skip to the Mexico-specific parts if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-road-incidents?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=USA~MEX~FRA&quot;&gt;Our World in Data&lt;/a&gt; for 2019:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death rate from road injuries / 100k population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;France: 5.8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USA: 11.1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mexico: 16.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;state-department-recommendations&quot;&gt;State department recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to trust the USA State Department instead of the official homicide data, they provide recommendations for each state in Mexico
(But trusting a government agency’s recommendations is no way to live life. &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewfromthewing.com/the-state-department-has-issued-its-highest-level-travel-warning-against-antarctica/&quot;&gt;Remember when the CDC said not to visit Antarctica because of COVID danger&lt;/a&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the recommendations in map form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/state-department-map-800-ca027cb7d.png&quot; alt=&quot;USA state department travel recommendations map&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/state-department-map-400-7d2e16324.webp 400w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/state-department-map-600-7d2e16324.webp 600w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/state-department-map-800-7d2e16324.webp 800w, /generated/2023-03-17-visiting-mexico/state-department-map-1000-7d2e16324.webp 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travelmaps.state.gov/TSGMap/?extent=-124.207939566,14.44327709,-84.313397286,33.446969624&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, Yucatan and Campeche (the light tan / unshaded ones on the bottom right) have the same rating as Switzerland, and yellow is the rating given to France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see these correlate somewhat with the homicide data but not as well as I’d imagine. Probably some of this is the State Department being slow to update their recommendations, and some of it is that they take things other than homicide into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crime-data&quot;&gt;Crime data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Homicide rates are per 100k population. Mexico data is 2022 data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://elcri.men/en/violence-map/&quot;&gt;El Crimen&lt;/a&gt; (Note: I spent a few minutes trying to get the official data for previous years from &lt;a href=&quot;https://datos.gob.mx/&quot;&gt;datos.gob.mx&lt;/a&gt; but I was unable to find it. If you can find it please let me know how). USA homicide numbers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend&quot;&gt;from the FBI&lt;/a&gt;. Where the FBI provided counts rather than rates, I divided by population numbers from the 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts&quot;&gt;US Census&lt;/a&gt;. For the USA I included both 2019 and 2020 because there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/what-caused-the-2020-homicide-spike&quot;&gt;a spike in homicides in 2020&lt;/a&gt; in the USA, so it’s hard to know which year is a more useful comparison. I threw in Paris for fun (I’m not sure if I interpreted the data correctly. I downloaded it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/crimes-et-delits-enregistres-par-les-services-de-gendarmerie-et-de-police-depuis-2012/#_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and summed rows 5-8, columns RD-RS).&lt;/p&gt;

I have been pleasantly surprised at how happy and productive I have been
working entirely remotely for the past ~17 months, but I was eager to meet people
in person. I live in the SF Bay Area, but my manager and almost all of the people
I manage are in the Seattle area, so a few weeks ago I travelled to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked from my team’s office area for a few days. Despite it being almost
completely empty, I did bump into one of my team members and we
went out to lunch together and had a great time. Besides that serendipitous encounter,
I arranged a meeting with my manager in a park, a meeting with a peer in a different park,
and a cruise on lakes Union and Washington for my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wrap&quot; src=&quot;/generated/2021-08-20-seeing-coworkers-in-person-again-cruise-800-5a194ba1a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;cruising with my team&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/2021-08-20-seeing-coworkers-in-person-again-cruise-400-65a7d6658.webp 400w, /generated/2021-08-20-seeing-coworkers-in-person-again-cruise-600-65a7d6658.webp 600w, /generated/2021-08-20-seeing-coworkers-in-person-again-cruise-800-65a7d6658.webp 800w, /generated/2021-08-20-seeing-coworkers-in-person-again-cruise-1000-65a7d6658.webp 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems likely to me that even after COVID-19 is a distant memory, a lot of
work will be done by geographically distributed teams. I believe wise companies
will take some of the money they save on office real estate and spend it instead
on paying for team members to regularly get together in person. In my
experience, in-person gatherings catalyze emotional bonds that can persist for a
long time and help make remote interactions more pleasant and productive. I
first noticed this years ago back when I still worked in an office every day,
but I was working closely with people who sat in an office in a different
continent. During my first business trip to visit them I felt very guilty for
wasting the company’s money. In terms of concrete business goals, I didn’t do
much on that trip to justify the travel bill. But over time I found that it was
easier for me to think of those coworkers as real people who I cared about
because we had hung out together and gotten to know each other, and that helped
me work with them for years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you’d like to join my team and meet me in person once in a while,
I’m hiring! &lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1036775/SENIOR-SOFTWARE-ENGINEER&quot;&gt;Apply

After spending quite
  a bit of time deciding what learning materials to start with, I decided on fast.ai&apos;s Practical Deep Learning for
  Coders (I saw the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://course19.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;2019 version&lt;/a&gt;). Overall I highly recommend the course,
  and I&apos;m planning to go back and do the 2020 version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I was excited about fast.ai&apos;s course is that they had some content on &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/swift&quot;&gt;Swift for TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(S4TF). I have written a lot of Python and
  while it has its place, I was excited to try something new and hopefully better. I watched the two fast.ai videos on
  S4TF and then decided to try it out. This ended up being a fairly costly mistake for me. Basically S4TF is just not
  nearly as mature as PyTorch, and I wasted a bunch of time struggling with environment setup (no equivalent
  to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;conda install&lt;/span&gt;), bugs, very incomplete documentation, and cryptic
  error messages. At this point (I tried in 2020-09), I suggest you steer clear of S4TF if your primary goal is just to
  learn ML. Though it was fun to learn some Swift and I&apos;d definitely consider using Swift in future projects, ML or
  otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that multi-week detour out of the way, I decided to focus on PyTorch. For my first task I decided to try to
  recreate the simplest model presented in the fast.ai course, but without using the fastai library at all, just pure
  PyTorch. I found that almost all of the special stuff in fastai is included in PyTorch as of 1.6, so this was a lot
  easier than I expected. Here&apos;s my final &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://github.com/garymm/mlnbs/blob/master/collaborative-filtering.ipynb&quot;&gt;notebook for this collaborative
    filtering task&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the issues I ran into and how I resolved them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For this task, using the GPU was much slower than just using the CPU. I suppose this is because the model is so
    simple that the overhead of copying data to/from the GPU dominates any speedup in actual calculations. In retrospect
    this was also probably why training my Swift version of the model was so slow, and &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/issues/524#issuecomment-680919423&quot;&gt;S4TF doesn&apos;t allow eager tensors to
      use the CPU&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if a GPU is present, so this would have been much harder to discover and work around in
    Swift.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fastai wraps the &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;torch.nn.Embedding&lt;/span&gt; type with a function that changes
    the initial values. PyTorch initializes using random values drawn from a normal distribution with&amp;nbsp;𝜎^2 = 1.
    Fastai changes this to a normal distribution with&amp;nbsp;𝜎^2 = .01, truncated so no value is farther than 2 standard
    deviations from the mean. They reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09160&quot;&gt;An Exploration of Word Embedding
      Initialization in Deep-Learning Tasks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as justification. I found this provided a small boost in
    performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forgot calls to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;squeeze()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; in a
      few places. I was quite surprised that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier;&quot;&gt;torch.nn.MSELoss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
      style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;didn&apos;t throw an error when I provided it two tensors of different shapes.
      Instead it did some averaging over all the values, which led to poor training performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                argues that
                education pays off for individuals mostly because it sends signals about intelligence and
                conscientiousness,
                &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;because it equips students with useful skills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                face=&quot;arial, sans-serif&quot; style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s a puzzle which was not addressed in the book,
                but may be solved by that
                model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;My university courses were mostly graded on curves. I
                think Advanced Placement exams are also graded on curves, but I&apos;m less sure of this. At the time this
                didn&apos;t
                make sense to me. If the point of taking the courses was to gain skills, shouldn&apos;t there be an objective
                scale
                of how much skill a student gained? And shouldn&apos;t students be graded against this objective scale,
                rather than
                on how they place in the distribution of students who happen to take the exam on the same day as them?
                Objective
                grading seems especially feasible for technical courses like math, but I could imagine it being
                plausible for
                humanities courses like history as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;But if the point of a school transcript is not so much
                to say &quot;Look at all these skills I acquired!&quot;, but rather to say &quot;Here&apos;s where I am in the distribution
                of
                students who got this degree at this university&quot;, then the mystery is dissolved. The latter is obviously
                more in
                accordance with the signaling model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course there are other reasonable explanations for
                grading on a curve, even in technical courses. If imposed by the department or university, it can be
                used as a
                defense against grade inflation. I believe it had that effect at my undergraduate university, where some
                departments had distributions that all professors were supposed to adhere to, and those departments had
                generally lower grades. But again, wanting to maintain the same grade distribution over many years is
                inconsistent with that grade being an objective measure of skill gained, unless we assume zero change in
                pedagogical methods, how much knowledge students have coming in, or just random variation in class
                achievement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>garymm</name></author><category term="education" /><summary type="html">I recently read The Case Against Education, which argues that education pays off for individuals mostly because it sends signals about intelligence and conscientiousness, not&amp;nbsp;because it equips students with useful skills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here&apos;s a puzzle which was not addressed in the book, but may be solved by that model.

And shouldn&apos;t students be graded against this objective scale, rather than on how they place in the distribution of students who happen to take the exam on the same day as them? Objective grading seems especially feasible for technical courses like math, but I could imagine it being plausible for humanities courses like history as well. But if the point of a school transcript is not so much to say &quot;Look at all these skills I acquired!&quot;, but rather to say &quot;Here&apos;s where I am in the distribution of students who got this degree at this university&quot;, then the mystery is dissolved. The latter is obviously more in accordance with the signaling model. Of course there are other reasonable explanations for grading on a curve, even in technical courses. If imposed by the department or university, it can be used as a defense against grade inflation. I believe it had that effect at my undergraduate university, where some departments had distributions that all professors were supposed to adhere to, and those departments had generally lower grades. But again, wanting to maintain the same grade distribution over many years is inconsistent with that grade being an objective measure of skill gained, unless we assume zero change in pedagogical methods, how much knowledge students have coming in, or just random variation in class achievement.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">4K, HDR, and MVC 3D in plex for Kodi on Windows</title><link href="http://garymm.org/blog/2017/12/31/4k-hdr-and-mvc-3d-in-plex-for-kodi-on/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="4K, HDR, and MVC 3D in plex for Kodi on Windows" /><published>2017-12-31T09:31:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-31T09:31:00-08:00</updated><id>http://garymm.org/blog/2017/12/31/4k-hdr-and-mvc-3d-in-plex-for-kodi-on</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://garymm.org/blog/2017/12/31/4k-hdr-and-mvc-3d-in-plex-for-kodi-on/">This took me forever to set up properly, so I figured I&apos;d share it.&lt;br /&gt;For now just the basic outline. If have
questions on a detail ask and I can answer.&lt;br /&gt;First my set-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Windows 10 64 bit with Fall Creators Update&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GeForce GTX 960&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2016 LG OLED TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic ingredients are these. Note I always used 64 bit versions of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=223175&quot;&gt;Kodi DSPlayer&lt;/a&gt;, I used 17.6, 64 bit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Plex for Kodi add-on, I used 0.1.3. Install it from within Kodi.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases&quot;&gt;LAV Filters&lt;/a&gt;, I used 0.70.2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madvr.com/&quot;&gt;MadVR&lt;/a&gt;, I used v0.92.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Install everything listed above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Replace Kodi DSPlayer&apos;s internal filters with the external ones: copy all the files files from &lt;span
            style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\LAV Filters\x64&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span
            style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;C:\Program
            Files\Kodi\system\players\dsplayer\LAVFilters&lt;/span&gt;, replacing files at the destination.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the nVidia control panel, disable stereoscopic 3D. With the current drivers, enabling it causes crashes in
        madVR when Direct3D 11 is enabled and it goes full screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have HDR and Advanced Color disabled in the Windows 10 display settings. MadVR enables it during playback as
        needed, and it makes the desktop look bad when it&apos;s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In Plex for Kodi Settings, enable HEVC streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the LG OLED TV settings, disable Screen Shift. This setting shifts the image around by 1 pixel every few
        minutes, which will result in the line-interlaced image output by madVR not being aligned with the FPR (3D
        filter), which results in the left and right eyes being swapped. Note this will increase the risk of image
        retention.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MadVR settings (just the required stuff, other settings you should probably mess with, lots of other guides on
        that):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;rendering -&amp;gt; general settings: Use Direct3D 11 for presentation (required for 10-bit color output)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;rendering -&amp;gt; stereo 3D: enable stereo 3D playback. Leave everything else unchecked.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Devices -&amp;gt; &lt;your avr=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; tv=&quot;&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; properties: the native display bitdepth is 10 bit or higher
                (required for 10-bit color output).&lt;/your&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Devices -&amp;gt; &lt;your avr=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; tv=&quot;&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; properties: 3D format is Line Alternative (this works for
                passive displays like LG OLEDs, *not* for any other kind of display)&lt;/your&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Devices -&amp;gt; &lt;your avr=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; tv=&quot;&quot;&gt; -&amp;gt; hdr: passthrough HDR content to the display, and send HDR
                metadata to the display&lt;/your&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

I think getting it has not been and will not be
worth the costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Some background on my situation: I am getting my degree from Stanford in Computer Science. I have worked at Google
    the whole time. I&apos;ve taken 15 classes (10 weeks each) over 5 years. No research or thesis, just classes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to get a degree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These are the main reasons I can think of to get a degree and why they&apos;re not good enough reasons for me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To gain useful skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Many people think one learns skills in school which can be used to do useful stuff outside of school. My
    objections:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Degrees are like a cable package&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To get my degree, I had to take 15 classes and I had limited freedom in choosing those 15. Of course each class is
    itself a bundle of topics, and I have no freedom to choose what topics get covered in each class. Sticking with the
    cable TV analogy, this is like having to watch an entire week&apos;s worth of a TV channel. I estimate at least 1/3 of
    the material I learned was totally useless for me. And as for the remaining 2/3, see the next point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I forget things that I don&apos;t use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is a lesson that I should have learned very early in this whole process. Stanford requires master&apos;s students
    who don&apos;t have a bachelor&apos;s from Stanford to take certain &quot;foundation&quot; undergraduate level CS classes to complete
    the master&apos;s degree.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One&apos;s adviser has the power to waive these requirements. I looked over the list of foundation requirements and
    thought &quot;I took all those classes already in undergrad, no need to take them again&quot;. So I went into my adviser&apos;s
    office and asked him to waive the requirements. He responded by verbally quizzing me on the spot about several of
    the topics. I miserably failed to recall basic details of these classes that I had gotten A&apos;s in a few years before.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At that point, it had been 2 years since I finished my bachelor&apos;s in CS, and I had been working full-time as a
    software engineer since then, yet &lt;b&gt;I hadn&apos;t used any of the stuff, so I forgot most of it pretty thoroughly&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since then I&apos;ve become ever more skeptical that it&apos;s useful to take classes now in the hopes of using the knowledge
    several years down the road. Maybe it will be useful some day, but if it&apos;s not any time soon, I may as well not have
    taken the class at all. My brain just doesn&apos;t work that way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To signal personal qualities to employers&lt;/h3&gt;There&apos;s a lot of evidence that employers value people with degrees not
because of the useful skills one gains in school, but because the completion of the degree shows one has certain
personal qualities: intelligence, perseverance, cooperativeness, conformity, etc. For more on this evidence, check out
this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/04/bryan_caplan_on.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awesome episode of
    EconTalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that employers think this way and thus degrees have some value. However in my
particular case, I already had a job at one of the most sought-after companies in my field. Even if I were to switch
companies but stay in software engineering, I&apos;m skeptical many employers would care about my degree now that I have 7
years of job experience from well-regarded companies. However I grant that this is an empirical question and I could
very well be proven wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the love of learning&lt;/h3&gt;I often enjoy learning new things, but doing it on someone else&apos;s schedule can be very
stressful. Over the course of my degree, I had more than one occassion where I had to stay up all night to finish a
shcool assignment and then I had a regular work day ahead of me. Even when I got to bed at a reasonable hour, doing all
the school work on nights and weekends after working a full work day / week really killed a lot of the fun for me. Also,
learning with other people is more fun than learning alone, but because I did the degree part-time and mostly
off-campus, I didn&apos;t get much contact with other students. Which brings me to the next point...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To meet people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I didn&apos;t get to meet many other students or hang out with the ones I did meet because I did my degree part-time,
    remotely and while working full time. This is in stark contrast to my undergrad experience, where I formed wonderful
    long-lasting relationships with people who I took classes with or who were just around campus or in the same dorm at
    the same time that I was.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to not get a degree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;My degree cost about $54,000 in tuition. My employer paid for
        most of it, but I still paid for some of it and honestly I&apos;d rather my employer used the money on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
            href=&quot;https://www.google.com/loon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;project loon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Because I was studying, I had less time for sleep, exercise, work, friends and family. These things are all
    extremely valuable to me. Given all my above objections, it should be clear I think most of the time I spent getting
    this degree would have been better spent on one of those other things. Now that I&apos;m almost done, I&apos;m not at all
    excited about how much knowledge or prestige I will have. I&apos;m excited that I&apos;ll have more time to spend on more
    important things.&lt;/div&gt;

I think getting it has not been and will not be worth the costs. Background Some background on my situation: I am getting my degree from Stanford in Computer Science. I have worked at Google the whole time. I&apos;ve taken 15 classes (10 weeks each) over 5 years. No research or thesis, just classes. Reasons to get a degree These are the main reasons I can think of to get a degree and why they&apos;re not good enough reasons for me. To gain useful skills Many people think one learns skills in school which can be used to do useful stuff outside of school.
